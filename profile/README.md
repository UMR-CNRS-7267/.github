# Facility presentation 

The bioinformatics platform **eBIOINF** of EBI, UMR CNRS7267 was founded at the end of 2012 with the aim of providing computational resources and knowledge  for the processing of omics data from new sequencing technologies (NGS :Next Generation Sequencing).
These omics techniques are genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics and meta-transcriptomics
This repository contains codes, programs and scripts developed or used in various projects and publications of UMR 7267 Lab.

# Facility members
